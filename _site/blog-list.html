        I don't know about you, but my kitchen has way too many gadgets. Garlic smashers, meat tenderizers, food choppers, apple peelers, the list goes on and on. My workshop is the same way - specialty tools for everything from drilling dowel holes to cutting dovetails. 99% of the time, whether it's in the kitchen or the workshop I reach for the simple tools. In the kitchen, my 9 inch chef's knife does 99% of what...

        I didn't make my goal. My self-imposed deadline was today and today is almost over, and we haven't launched yet. We are really close - but not quite there. The last two weeks have been grueling. I've started every day around 6am and finished every day after 11pm. And we've accomplished a lot over the last few weeks: * I've finished three themes (two church and one for pastors and evangelists.) * I've standardized these...

        Our First Site Is Up! The very first site using the Sitesfor.Church system is live at [Bible Baptist Church.](http://biblebaptistmattoon.org) It's using our **California** theme. A few people requested a working demo - so here it is - going through the live site and showing how each section of content is managed using our Airtable system. Check out the youtube video below: In the next few days, I should be able to show you another site...

        **At Sitesfor.Church we are weird and proud of it.** If you know any of us - you'd probably heartily agree, but that isn't what I was talking about. Our websites are weird. There are a lot of things that make us weird, but one of the main ones is that our sites are **static.** Typical sites, like those running Wordpress, run a program on a server and whenever you click on a link, that program...

        ### Sitesfor.church will be launching Monday, June 25! Dear prospective client, It's been a wild couple of weeks, and we've cleared most of the technical hurdles that were keeping us from launching sitesfor.church. I'm excited to say that we are getting close and have decided to set a deadline for June 25 and work like mad to get everything ready by then. ## Here is what that means for you: ### Documentation I've written a...

But every website is going to have some learning curve. We've learned over the years that often, in an attempt to make websites easier for nontechnical people, you can actually make things more complicated. We think we've found the best mix of ease of use and necessary complexity. Many of our...

        Recently, at Sitesfor.church, we made the decision to use [Airtable](http://airtable.com) as the backbone of our church websites. Airtable is an online database app (if Google Sheets and Microsoft Access had a baby it would look like Airtable.) Using an app like this is a radical move - as far as we know no other web design company is doing - but we think you are going to love it. Why? We thought of ten reasons...

        Sitesfor.church has two goals: 1. Provide the best church website experience ever at a price even small churches can afford. 2. Provide jobs for ministers-in-training that will help support them as well as build essential skills they can bring into the ministry. The first goal has been our prime focus as we’ve worked on this, but as we launch (Hopefully at the beginning of May) we hope to transition our efforts to the second goal....
